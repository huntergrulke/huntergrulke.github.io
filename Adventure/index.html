   <p> We drove past vast ampunts of cornfields today, IMAGE then afterwards we stopped at mcdonals for a quick bite to eat.
It was awsome seeing nothing but cornfields and farmhouses for miles since I love the country. IMAGE horse drawn buggies which
are an horse drawn version of a car. They are also really funny they were are cool but disapointed dispit the signs telling us there were buggies we saw none. But
atleast we packed Energy drink,Candy,Cell phone charger,Warm clothes,Food. </p>

        <h2 style="color:Tomato;style="font-family:verdana;"> July 8, 2020 </h2>
  <p>  As we pullup to the sign we notice it says, IMAGE "Welcome to Wisconsin Dells the Waterpark Capital of the World." We got
very excited at the fact that we were almost to our destination and couldn't wait to get there.</p>

  <p>  Been driving for a little bit now and the roads have been very curvy and now there are very busy throughout downtown
 but I mean what do you expect for driving for driving downtown through the dells. But you know what that means we
 are  to the famouse sandstone cliffs bording the Wisconsin River IMAGE they are so amazing they are also cliffs made out
 of sandstone which were wethered away by the elements.</p>
